Task: Please generate an agent-based model that simulate ant diffusion. This ABM should compose Environment, Home, Food, Ant, AntWorld, The Environment are described by pos, amount, The Environment should have activities: step, advance, add, get_pos, The Home are described by pos, amount, The Home should have activities: add, The Food are described by amount, The Food should have activities: add, eaten, any_food, The Ant are described by pos, state, drop, home, moore, The Ant should have activities: get_item, step, drop_pheromone, random_move, home_move, gradient_move, The AntWorld are described by evaporate, diffusion, initdrop, lowerbound, prob_random, drop_rate, schedule, grid, home, next_id, foods, grid, home, schedule, home, next_id, home, grid, home, schedule, next_id, foods, grid, schedule, grid, next_id, grid, schedule, running, dc, home, foods, foods, foods, The AntWorld should have activities: step, You can build get_distance, to help model. You can also use package mesa to help model.

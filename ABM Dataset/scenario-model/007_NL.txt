Task: Please generate an agent-based model that simulate infection and testing to determine trade-offs of quantity vs. turn-around time. This ABM should compose Contact_Trace_Agent, Contact_Trace_Model, The Contact_Trace_Agent are described by unique_id, day, step, contacts, family, coworkers, random_people, symptomatic, state, ever_infected, incubation, infectious_period, quarantine_countdown, recovered, immune, quarantined, infectious, random_contacts, quarantine_ingorer, The Contact_Trace_Agent should have activities: move, infect, test, get_random_agent, check_sick, The Contact_Trace_Model are described by num_agents, schedule, schedule, grid, infection_chance, incubation, infectious_period, infection_chance, incubation_period, presypmtomatic_infectious_period, percent_asymptomatic, immunity_percent, percent_employed_small, perecent_employed_medium, percent_employed_large, family_size, random_contact_mean, random_contact_sd, contact_trace_percent, false_positive_rate, false_negative_rate, percent_tested_per_day, turn_around_time, class_dict, random_contact_mean, random_contact_sd, num_agents, num_agents, num_agents, num_agents, family_size, family_size, num_agents, incubation, incubation, infectious_period, infectious_period, dining_dict, dining_dict, dining_dict, schedule, running, datacollector, datacollector, The Contact_Trace_Model should have activities: step, You can build percent_sick, num_infectious, quarantined, to help model. You can also use package mesa to help model.

Task: Please generate an agent-based model that simulate traffic intersection. This ABM should compose Vehicle, Intersection, Stopsign, Stoplight, The Vehicle are described by maxspeed, time, t, stop, acceleration, start, start, destination, equation, start, destination, position, equation, speed, start, destination, equation, position, equation, speed, The Vehicle should have activities: move, set_pos, get_pos, set_t, get_t, set_stop, get_stop, set_speed, get_speed, set_maxspeed, get_maxspeed, get_acceleration, set_dest, get_dest, get_time, get_start, get_loc, The Intersection are described by vehicles, vehicles, The Intersection should have activities: add_vehicle, add, get_vehicles, show, timestep, animate, simulate, The Stopsign are described by busy, The Stopsign should have activities: add_vehicle, add, get_vehicles, animate, simulate, show, timestep, The Stoplight are described by light, cycle_time, cur_time, The Stoplight should have activities: add_vehicle, add, get_vehicles, animate, simulate, show, timestep, You can build down_up, left_right, up_down, right_left, down_right, left_down, up_left, right_up, down_left, left_up, up_right, right_down, to help model.

Task: Please generate an agent-based model that simulate the NaSchTraffic traffic flow with the VehicleAgents and responsive street-lights. This ABM should compose VehicleAgent, StreetLightAgent, NaSchTraffic, The VehicleAgent are described by pos, speed, max_speed, _next_pos, happy, The VehicleAgent should have activities: step, advance, The StreetLightAgent are described by pos, light_range, lit_state, historic_lit_state, The StreetLightAgent should have activities: step, advance, The NaSchTraffic are described by height, width, vehicle_density, general_max_speed, p_randomisation, debug, schedule, grid, light_range, lighting_grid, agent_position_log, total_street_lights, total_speed, total_happy, total_vehicles, total_flow, average_speed, average_happy, current_density, average_lighting_level, speed_averages, happiness_averages, densities, flows, lighting_averages, debug, debug, datacollector, datacollector, light_range, light_range, light_range, schedule, total_street_lights, debug, total_street_lights, grid, random, vehicle_density, grid, schedule, debug, running, datacollector, The NaSchTraffic should have activities: step, You can also use package mesa to help model.

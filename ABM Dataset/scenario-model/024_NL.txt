Task: Please generate an agent-based model that simulate Self-Organized Criticality (SOC), it implements a version of a Producer-Distributor-Consumer model which gives interesting and unpredictable behavior for aggregate income even when demand variation is low or zero.. This ABM should compose SOCEconModel, EconAgent, The SOCEconModel are described by num_agents, num_products, p_consumers, num_consumers, p_orders, do_rewire, fix_demand, products, production_levels, num_suppliers, period_demand, period_income, total_income, cascades, reactions, schedule, data_collector, num_agents, schedule, production_levels, schedule, schedule, num_suppliers, schedule, production_levels, running, data_collector, The SOCEconModel should have activities: step, The EconAgent are described by wealth, income, MPC, is_producer, demand, inventory, input_inventory, supply, producer_level, suppliers, output_orders, input_orders, order_history, order_history, cascade_id, model, is_producer, wealth, producer_level, model, is_producer, producer_level, wealth, demand, model, model, The EconAgent should have activities: show_demand, order, fill_order, get_agent_by_id, rewire, step, You can build get_period_income, get_period_demand, to help model. You can also use package mesa to help model.

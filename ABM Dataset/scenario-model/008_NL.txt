Task: Please generate an agent-based model that simulate covid resource allocation. This ABM should compose Agent, Location, Simulation, AgentFactory, The Agent are described by role, infected, transmission_rate, curr_coord, curr_location, journey, epsilon, time_spent, loc_idx, The Agent should have activities: risk_transmission, get_next_location, get_next_coord, move, The Location are described by name, size, adj_rooms, time_required, position, The Location should have activities: add_adj_room, get_adj_room_coord, __repr__, The Simulation are described by location, agents, t, statistics, total_transmissions, The Simulation should have activities: print_state, print_statistics, step, compute_statistics, run, The AgentFactory are described by creation_rate, infected_rate, transmission_rate, agents, journeys, entrance, The AgentFactory should have activities: create_agent, 
Programming Language: Python.

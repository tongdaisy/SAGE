Task: Please generate an agent-based model that simulate duplicitous spread of a deep fake videos through a social network, through the lens of gender and race.. This ABM should compose Belief_State, Race, Gender, MyAgent, DeepFakeSpreadModel, The MyAgent are described by age, random, gender, race, belief_state, videoGender, videoRace, infection_time, The MyAgent should have activities: move, contact, step, toJSON, The DeepFakeSpreadModel are described by initialDupedProb, videoGender, videoRace, pWatch, pDuped, pStayDuped, pStayInformed, genderMatchMult, raceMatchMult, pNeutral, pFlag, flags, flagsThreshold, num_agents, num_nodes, num_nodes, G, num_nodes, G, G, num_nodes, G, G, grid, G, schedule, running, G, schedule, grid, datacollector, datacollector, The DeepFakeSpreadModel should have activities: step, You can build gen_probs, get_flags, get_network, to help model. You can also use package mesa to help model.

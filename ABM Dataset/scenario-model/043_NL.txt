Task: Please generate an agent-based model that simulate spread of rumor. This ABM should compose Agent, Network, Rumor, Simulation, Main, The Agent are described by agent_id, neighbors, trusted_sources, rumors_heard, The Agent should have activities: hear_rumor, verify_rumor, spread_rumor, The Network are described by agents, The Network should have activities: add_agent, get_agent, get_random_agent, The Rumor are described by rumor_id, initial_agent_id, source, spread_agents, The Rumor should have activities: add_spread_agent, The Simulation are described by network, rumor, The Simulation should have activities: run, The Main are described by network, create_agents, rumor, simulation, network, rumor, The Main should have activities: create_agents, run_simulation, print_rumor_spread, Then, you should implement the simulation.

Task: Please generate an agent-based model that simulate ocean ecology with nuclearwaste. This ABM should compose Agent, Fish, Shark, NuclearWaste, MarinePlant, Predator, Ocean, The Agent are described by x, y, The Agent should have activities: move, The Fish are described by energy, The Fish should have activities: move, eat, reproduce, suffer_toxicity, update, The Shark are described by energy, The Shark should have activities: move, eat, reproduce, update, The NuclearWaste are described by toxicity_level, decay_rate, The NuclearWaste should have activities: move, spread_toxicity, update, decay, get_nearby_agents, The MarinePlant are described by energy, The MarinePlant should have activities: move, grow, update, The Predator are described by energy, The Predator should have activities: move, eat, update, The Ocean are described by width, height, agents, agents, agents, agents, agents, agents, The Ocean should have activities: update, find_nearby_fish, find_nearby_nuclear_waste, Then, you should implement the simulation.  
Programming Language: Python.

Task: There are modifing solutions. Please modify the original program according to these solutions to address the problem "control the total number of students".
Solutions:
1. Introduce a maximum limit for the number of students in the School class. Limit the enrollment process when the number of students reaches the maximum limit.
   - Add a parameter "max_num_students" to the __init__ method of the School class.
   - Modify the enroll_student method in the School class to check if the maximum limit has been reached before enrolling a new student.
   - Adjust the simulation code to set the maximum limit for the number of students.
2. Implement a graduation system to ensure a balance between new enrollments and students graduating.
   - Add a variable "graduation_grade" to the School class to represent the grade at which students graduate.
   - Modify the simulation code to check if any student has reached the graduation grade before enrolling new students.
   - Implement a method in the School class to handle the graduation process and remove graduated students.

Task: There is an agent-based model that simulates the school life. The problem we want to address is control the total number of students.  Please give some solutions to address this problem, and then modify the original program according to the solutions.
Original program:
import random
#Define Agent class
class Student:
    def __init__(self, id, grade, is_attending=True):
        self.id = id
        self.grade = grade
        self.is_attending = is_attending

    def change_grade(self, new_grade):
        self.grade = new_grade
    
    def change_attendance(self, is_attending):
        self.is_attending = is_attending

class Teacher:
    def __init__(self, id):
        self.id = id

    def give_lecture(self, subject):
        print(f"Teacher {self.id} is giving a lecture on {subject}")

class School:
    def __init__(self, num_students, num_teachers):
        self.students = [Student(id, random.randint(1, 12)) for id in range(num_students)]
        self.teachers = [Teacher(id) for id in range(num_teachers)]
        self.total_num_students=num_students

    def enroll_student(self, student):
        self.students.append(student)
        self.total_num_students+=1
    
    def hire_teacher(self, teacher):
        self.teachers.append(teacher)

class Lecture:
    def __init__(self, school, subject):
        self.school = school
        self.subject = subject

    def start(self):
        for teacher in self.school.teachers:
            teacher.give_lecture(self.subject)

    def end(self):
        print("Lecture has ended.")
#Simulation Process
def simulation(num_students, num_teachers, subject):
    school = School(num_students, num_teachers)
    lecture = Lecture(school, subject)
    for student in school.students:
        new_grade = random.randint(1, 12)
        student.change_grade(new_grade)
    for i in range(10):
        lecture.start()
        for student in school.students:
            is_attending = random.choice([True, False])
            student.change_attendance(is_attending)
            if is_attending:
                student.change_grade(student.grade + 1)
        lecture.end()
        num_new_student = random.randint(10, 20)
        new_students = [Student(id, random.randint(1, graduate_grade)) for id in
                        range(len(school.students), len(school.students) + num_new_student)]
        for s in new_students:
            school.enroll_student(s)
#Example Usage
simulation(num_students=100, num_teachers=10, subject="Math",)

Solutions & Modified Program: 

Solutions:
1. Limit the enrollment process when the number of students reaches the maximum limit.
2. Implement a graduation system to ensure a balance between new enrollments and students graduating.

Modified Program:
import xxx
class school():
    ....# omitted program
...
def simulation():
    ...
   #omitted here
